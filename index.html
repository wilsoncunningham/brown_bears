      <p>The brown bear (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) is a large mammal native to parts of northern
        Eurasia and North America. Known for its impressive size and strength,
        this species has adapted to a variety of habitats, from forests to mountainous regions.
        Currently, the brown bear's conservation status is <strong>Least Concern</strong>,
        indicating a stable population in many of its native areas.
        There are numerous subspecies within the brown bear species,
        each adapted to their specific environments. Notable subspecies include the Atlas bear,
        which was once found in North Africa but is now extinct, and the Himalayan brown bear,
        which inhabits the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. These diverse subspecies
        showcase the brown bear's remarkable adaptability and resilience across different ecosystems.
